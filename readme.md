# KaboomJS with Typescript & Parcel

In order for the parcel compiler to work, you need to have TypeScript installed globally. Parcel uses `tsc` to build the bundle.

> Note: This build is using a preview version of kaboom. API may change!

### Development
Use the `npm run dev` command to start developing.

### Production
Use the `npm run build` command to build for production.
